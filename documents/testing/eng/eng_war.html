Artificial intelligence and warfare.

Let's talk about what this really could look like.


Let's talk about what this really could look like.

Swarms of lethal drones with facial recognition

that know your every move.

Or unmanned armed robots that are near impossible to defeat.

Autonomous fighter jets that can travel at supersonic speeds

Cyberattacks that incapacitate critical port infrastructure

or disinformation campaigns and deepfakes that throw presidential elections.

Or even foreign adversaries taking out satellites,

our eyes and ears in space,

rendering us blind to global events.

All superintelligent weapons of terror.

We are at the dawn of a new age of warfare.
