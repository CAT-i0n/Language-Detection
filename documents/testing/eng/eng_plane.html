By 1917, Albert Einstein had explained the relationship between space and time.

But, that year, he designed a flawed airplane wing.

His attempt was based on an incomplete theory of flight.

Indeed, insufficient and inaccurate explanations still circulate today.

So, where did Einstein go wrong?

And how do planes fly?

Though we don’t always think of it this way, air is a fluid medium—

it’s just less dense than liquids like water.

Things that are lighter than air are buoyant within it,

while heavier objects require an upward force, called lift, to stay aloft.

For planes, this force is mostly generated by the wings.
