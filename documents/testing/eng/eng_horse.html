People have been captivated by horses for a long time.

They appear more than any other animal in cave paintings

dating back 30,000 years.

But how did horses make the journey from wild animals

ones humans could hitch themselves to and even ride,

determining the fate of civilizations and dramatically altering history?

Equids originally evolved in North America.

Sometime after 4 million years ago,

ancient equid species began trotting across the Bering land bridge.

Eventually, they spread through Eurasia and into Africa,

diversifying into the lineages that would lead to modern-day horses,

donkeys, and zebras.

Early humans, including generations of the first people to live in the Americas,

hunted wild horses, sometimes fashioning their bones into tools.

Then, between 15,000 and 5,000 years ago,

likely because of a changing climate, hunting by humans,

and competition with bison,

horses disappeared from the American archaeological record.
